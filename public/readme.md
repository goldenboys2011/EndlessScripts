# Endless Scripts — Public Edition

Welcome to the **Endless Scripts Public Edition**!

This is a public script pool that allows anyone to install custom cheat scripts directly through the game.

## Install a Script

In-game, simply run:

```
script install {name}
```

This will automatically download `{name}.enscript`
from the public script pool and add it to your local scripts folder.

## Upload Your Script

Want to share your own creation? Here’s how:

1. **[Fork this repository](https://github.com/goldenboys2011/EndlessScripts/fork)**  
2. Add your script file inside the [`public`](https://github.com/goldenboys2011/EndlessScripts/tree/main/public) folder  
   - Example: `public/mycoolscript.enscript`
3. **[Create a Pull Request](https://github.com/goldenboys2011/EndlessScripts/compare)**  
   - In the PR description, explain what your script does and its install name  
4. Wait for approval from a maintainer (check the **[Pull Requests tab](https://github.com/goldenboys2011/EndlessScripts/pulls)** for updates)  
5. Once approved, it becomes instantly installable by all users 🎉

## Notes

- Only upload **safe, single-file scripts** (no external network calls or malicious code).  
- Do **not** submit copyrighted or stolen code.  
- Use descriptive names (e.g. `autoBridge.enscript`, not `script1.enscript`).  
- You can update your script anytime by submitting a new PR.
